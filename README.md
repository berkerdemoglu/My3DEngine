# My3DEngine
A 3D Engine from scratch, written in Java.

### Python API & JSON
The engine has an API that allows the developer to use Python as their
choice of language. It includes functions/methods that convert objects
into JSON, and then process them in Java.

This also means that one can provide a JSON file to the engine,
but the use of the Python API is highly recommended.
